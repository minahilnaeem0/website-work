    <p>Avocados are high in fat with 60 per cent of this being monounsaturated fats,
         which research suggests helps to protect against heart disease and lower blood pressure. 
         They are also an excellent source of potassium, folate and fibre,
         all of which benefit the heart and cardiovascular system.</p>
